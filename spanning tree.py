#it is only for undirected graph
#In General  "spanning" means:Covering all the parts of something.
#In the case of a spanning tree:
#Spanning" means the tree reaches (covers) all the vertices of the graph.
#You're not skipping any node — every node is included and connected.
#The basic idea of a Spanning Tree is:A spanning tree is a subgraph of a connected graph that includes all the vertices and 
#forms a tree — meaning no cycles and the minimum number of edges needed to keep all nodes connected.

#There are two ways to find minimum spanning tree:
#Prim's Algorithm
#Kruskal's Algorithm
